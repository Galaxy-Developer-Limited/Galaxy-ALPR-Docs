# Galaxy ALPR App ‚Äì Database

This folder manages the relational database for the Galaxy ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) App. It provides persistent storage for vehicle detections, license plates, session logs, and location metadata.

## Project Purpose

The database is designed to:
- Store all vehicle and license plate detections from the ALPR pipeline.
- Track detection sessions, including images, processing times, and locations.
- Maintain metadata for each vehicle and plate, including region, type, and status (whitelist/blacklist).
- Support analytics, dashboard statistics, and API queries for the backend.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Database:** SQLite (default, file-based, easy for local/dev; can be swapped for PostgreSQL or others)
- **ORM/Access:** Python `sqlite3` module (see `database.py`)
- **Schema Management:** Programmatic migrations in `database.py` (no external migration tool required)
- **Directory:** All schema and DB logic is in the `database/` folder

## Table Descriptions

- **detection_sessions**: Each detection event; links to original and processed images, processing time, and location.
- **vehicles**: Each detected vehicle in a session; stores class, image, and bounding box.
- **plates**: Each detected license plate; stores cropped image, OCR text, confidence, and rich metadata (type, region, color, etc.).
- **locations**: Named entry/exit points; referenced by sessions.
- **plate_status**: Tracks whitelist/blacklist status for plate texts.

---

## Example Data Flow

1. **Image Upload:** User uploads an image via API.
2. **Detection:** Pipeline detects vehicles and plates, saves crops and metadata.
3. **Session Insert:** New row in `detection_sessions` with image paths, time, location.
4. **Vehicle Insert:** Each detected vehicle is added to `vehicles` (linked to session).
5. **Plate Insert:** Each detected plate is added to `plates` (linked to vehicle), with all OCR and region metadata.
6. **Status Update:** If a plate is whitelisted/blacklisted, `plate_status` is updated and all matching plates are marked.

---

## Database Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python 3.8+** (if not already installed)
2. **No external DB install needed** (uses SQLite by default)
3. **First run:** The schema is auto-created by `database.py` when the backend starts.

### Manual DB Management

- The SQLite file is created at `backend/detections.db` (or as configured).
- Use any SQLite browser (e.g., [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)) for inspection.

---

## SQL Scripts / Migration

- **No separate migration scripts**: All schema creation is handled in `Database.init_db()` in `database.py`.
- To reset the DB, delete the `.db` file and restart the backend.

---

## Usage in API Backend

- All database access is via the `Database` class in `database.py`.
- The backend uses this class for all CRUD operations, statistics, and dashboard queries.
- See `database.py` for method documentation and usage.

---

## How the DB is Used by the API

- **Detection Endpoints:** Insert sessions, vehicles, and plates on each detection.
- **Query Endpoints:** Fetch sessions, vehicles, plates, and statistics for dashboards.
- **Plate Status Endpoints:** Manage whitelist/blacklist and synchronize plate statuses.
- **Location Endpoints:** Manage entry/exit locations for detections.

---

## Local Development

- **Local:** No setup required; DB file is created on first run.
- **Config:** Change the DB path by passing a different `db_path` to the `Database` class.
